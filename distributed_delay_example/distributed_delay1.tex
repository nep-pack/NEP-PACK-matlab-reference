\begin{problem}
Delay-differential equations involving a
weighted mean of past states,
also known as delay-differential
equations with distributed delays, can be
natural when modeling delays 
where the value of a
delay is not accurately known.
This NEP from \cite{Jarlebring:2012:INFARNDISTDELAY}
stems from a
delay-differential equation with a distributed delay
and 
has the form 
\[
 R(\lambda)=-\lambda I+A_1+A_2e^{-\tau\lambda}+A_3\int_{-1}^0
e^{\lambda s}(e^{(s+\frac12)^2}-e^{\frac14})\,ds.
\] 
where $A_1,A_2,A_3\in\RR^{3\times 3}$.
